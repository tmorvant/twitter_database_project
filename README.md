# twitter_database

Project for COMS 363, an intro database management class. This specific project is to provide a java application that can access and analyze the twitter data.
To run project, open project in eclipse editor. Check to make sure connectorJ is added to the build path. If no errors in build path, pressing run on project.java will run 
application. Enter information into console with no typos.

Features will eventually be added for better UI functionality as project currently uses eclipse terminal for ease of testing and results.
